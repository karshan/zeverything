-- | A list of tasks running in a functor of type @f@ on zippers with root type
-- @r@ producing results typed @a@.

-- | A single traversal Task.

  , getFunction :: Visit f r a -- ^ Function to apply to @zipper@

-- | Function to visit a zipper and complete a single task.
type Visit f r a = Zipper r -- ^ The zipper to visit
  -> TaskList f r a -- ^ List of remaining tasks
  -> f (a, TaskList f r a) -- ^ Result and updated list of remaining tasks

-- | Function to collect results.
